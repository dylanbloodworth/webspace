i had a thought today about turning twenty-six and being kicked off dad's insurance. that thought coinciding with the fact that i may not be working when I do turn twenty-six--and therefore no health insurance of my own--started to worry me. from there, obviously, thoughts began to spiral in their nature way.

_can i get health insurance while at school?_ i might need to get a part-time job with benefits. or maybe i need to enroll in medicaid if i decide to not get a job. or maybe i hope i stay healthy for the year that im in school again.

_how am I going to pay for school?_ i'm working my crappy grocery stocking job at lowes foods, but that surely will never be enough to pay for the second semester of tuition.

_should i even go back to school?_ the grocery job isn't that bad to be perfectly honest. i could see myself to trying to make rent. i don't have to think too much, 7 hour days honestly don't feel too long, and i'm rarely stressed out when working.

_do i want to be a teacher?_ i'm could just be looking at teaching through rose-colored glasses. i've tried to make convince myself to make educational videos--even just a simple youtube short--but with no real progress. i either don't feel motivated to work on it or i get too in my head about it needing to be this amazing and thought-provoking youtube short.

_what am i willing to care enough about to put time into?_ assume i want to be a teacher. if i can't get myself to work on a video about education or read something about teaching like philosophy or practice, then its confusing that i can't get myself to work towards achieving that goal.

_why don't have any friends?_ im on my phone a lot, watching youtube videos and twitch livestreams instead of working on these different projects. they've seemingly replaced social interactions. i find myself on my phone for 8 hours day in my room, then getting my fill of social interaction from my phone or from work. it doesn't feel like i have any friends right now.

_am i unloveable? do i give off the vibe that i don't want to be friends with people? why can't i reach out to other people? am i not funny? am i not caring? do i even do anything about it? is it my fault?_
