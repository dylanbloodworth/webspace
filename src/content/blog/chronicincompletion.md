I'm an overthinker.

A little overthinking never hurt anyone, but my overthinking lately has been less than benign. In the past few months, countless creative projects have been started, worked on, and then prematurely stopped. Just tonight, an urge to draw in my sketchbook struck. So, I grabbed my sketchbook and pen off the bookshelf in my parents' guestroom. I sat down on the floor, turned to the next clean page, and promptly drew 4 quick sketches of a roll of toilet paper. Then I gave up. Why give up, you might ask? To put it lightly, the sketches were rough. Before grabbing the sketchbook, excitement for drawing was blossoming -- but dude -- excitement leaves a person so quickly after a couple poorly drawn toilet paper rolls.

Fast forward two hours -- roughly 10:15pm. I set a challenge for myself: in two hours, write the simplest song you could possibly play on the guitar and put some lyrics to it. This sounded easy enough. I had been particularly excited to play music today. I grabbed my guitar, strummed a few chords from a progression I had been working on that afternoon, and recorded some takes until I was happy with what my novice fingers could handle. Now, lyrics. I start humming a few lines I thought sounded interesting, ready to put pen to paper for some decent enough lyrics. But I stopped. I stopped because the playback revealed to me that my singing was terrible. Why create a song when it'll just turn out awful? God, the singing was so bad.

A few months ago, a sewing project was started -- it's now about halfway done. A few weeks ago, I coded some animations for an educational YouTube short that connected the mathematical equations for simple harmonic motion and circular motion -- I've generated a single animation for it. A few days ago, I recorded clips and b-roll with the intention of creating a video in a day. The video was supposed to be about overthinking.

At the moment, I have no problem starting a project, but have a big problem with committing to finishing them. And it's a product of my overthinking. Any creative endeavour is shrouded behind thoughts of inadequacy or questions of self-importance. Am I even good enough to make this? Why would anyone care if I made this anyway? What makes me think I can make this? Am I really that full of myself? Are you doing this for someone else?

I'm an overthinker.

Sometimes it's helpful, but currently, it's trapping me in this crazy self-doubt genjutsu. Even now, I plan to release this post (if you're reading this, then it looks like I did), but a nagging voice in the deep recesses of my brain is yelling, "This isn't worth it! This piece sucks, and you're just doing it to complain to other people!" Weirdly, this piece would never have existed if not for the voice's yelling. A piece of writing meant to both simultaneously explain and defy that voice.
